	<h1>User Persona</h1>
	<h2>Edward: Plant Forgetter & registered user</h2>
	<img src="edward.webp" alt="Photo of Edward">
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Edward like to have plants around the house because it reminds him of growing up in Costa Rica. He is bad at
		remembering when to water them and how much, and has had to throw out an embarrassing number of dead, dried up
		house plants. He has a busy schedule and is very active on social media, so he almost always has his phone on
		him.</p>

	<h3>Frustrations</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Not knowing how to take care of his plants.</li>
		<li>Having to throw out plants he let die.</li>
		<li>Things that can't be automated.</li>
		<li>Getting plants as gifts with no instructions for taking care of them.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Needs</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Edward needs regular reminders to water his plants.</li>
		<li>The reminders should tell him which plant needs water, and how much.</li>
	</ul>
