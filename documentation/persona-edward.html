	<h3>User Story</h3>
	<p>"As a busy user, I want to use technology to help me keep my house plants alive."</p>
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Edward likes to have plants around the house because it reminds him of growing up in Costa Rica. He is bad at
		remembering when to water them and how much, and has had to throw out an embarrassing number of dead, dried up
		house plants. He has a busy schedule and is very active on social media, so he almost always has his phone on
		him.</p>
	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Devices: Has a Macbook Pro for work, got an iPhone 11 and 8th gen iPad for personal use to avoid learning a
			new OS.</li>

		<li>Comfort: Highly proficient with all of his devices.</li>
		<li>Attitude: Likes to be a power-user with technology that saves him time.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Not knowing how to take care of his plants.</li>
		<li>Having to throw out plants he let die.</li>
		<li>Things that can't be automated.</li>
		<li>Getting plants as gifts with no instructions for taking care of them.</li>
	</ul>

	</ul>

	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>Edward's goal is to keep a wide variety of houseplants and keep them healthy with as little frustration as
